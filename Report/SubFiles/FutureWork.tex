\section{Future Work}
While this study has revealed some potentially useful features, more work may be done to build upon it. One way is to repeat the process but prune less features. Another is to approach the feature selection for the POS and bleached features differently, such as using more than one n-gram type and uncovering distinguishing features in other n-gram types.

Other potentially useful features are the use of misspelt words, the use of excessive punctuation or the use of emojis. Other forms of bleaching presented in \cite{5} may also be tested, with different n-gram types. Other studies may also opt to perform the work using only a subset of the data, such as considering only one age range.
