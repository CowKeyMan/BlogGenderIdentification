\section{Introduction}
In this report, the task of Gender Identification on a Blog Corpus is implemented trough the use of Natural Language Processing techniques. The goal is to build a classifier which is able to recognize the differences in writing style between male and female writers. The problem is to find the ideal features which will allow the classifier to discriminate best between male and female writers. For this approach, any feature which is related to topic is avoided, purely focusing on the style of writing. This is particularly difficult because the aim is to try and find similarities across an entire group of authors, because while individuals may have their own style of writing, it is more difficult to generalise the style of a set of people \cite{3}.


The solution to the gender identification problem has applications in areas such as forensics \cite{2, 6} and cybercriminal analysis \cite{1}, so the idenity of a suspect may be narrowed down to one gender. Another application is in marketing \cite{6}, to find the demographic of some outlet.

The following chapters will discuss previous work done in this area, a description of the corpus in question, the approach taken to solve this problem and an evaluation on the model built.
